### Course Outcomes:
On completion of the course, the student will have the ability to:

1. Analyse various causes of defects (cracks and deflection) in structural members.
2. Explain the mechanism of corrosion of RC components.
3. Identify the role of structural health monitoring and carry out NDT.
4. Identify the types and causes of settlement of structures.
5. Select a suitable type of remedial measure / treatment strategy after careful analysis of the problem.
6. Perform the non-linear analysis of RC structural components using software.

### Course Content:
1. To identify cracks in different buildings, followed by analysis to identify their possible reasons and to find appropriate treatment strategies.
2. Corrosion of RC components, its identification, background causes and remedial measures based on analysis.
3. Deflection of structural members, problem identification and treatment strategies.
4. Settlement of a structure, its causes, and measures to control it.
5. Structural Health monitoring, problem identification and NDT to quantify the problem.
6. Analysis of RC structural components using non-linear analysis software.
