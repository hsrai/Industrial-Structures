## Theory of Structural Stability

Credits- 3:0:0 = 3

Teaching Scheme Lectures: 3 hrs/week

### Course Outcomes:
On completion of the course, the student will have the ability to:

1.  Learn the basic requirements of structural design, including stability
in addition to strength and stiffness.  Understand the classical concept of
stability of discrete and continuous systems, linear and nonlinear
behaviour.  
2.  Determine the buckling loads for simple columns by
analytical solution.  Have appreciation of combined axial, flexural and
torsion buckling.  
3.  Investigate stability of frames with respect to
member buckling and global buckling.  Find slenderness ratio of frame
members.  
4.  Study stability of beams with respect to lateral torsion
buckling.  
5.  Study the stability of plates like axial flexural buckling,
shear flexural buckling, buckling under combined loads.  
6.  An appreciation
of the fundamental basis of design rules concerned with structural
instability.
